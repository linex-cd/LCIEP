# LCIEP
URL Protocol on Windows
Linex Custom IE Protocol

The code is very old. I wrote it 8 years ago when I began learning programming.
I believed the URL protocol just used on IE, so I called it IE Protocol. Now I know it is URL Protocol and also runs for other broswers.

Today I use it on my another project, but I will not change its name.
And I uploaded it to Github, it is a really great place to share it.
